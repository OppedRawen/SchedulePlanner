# Schedule Planner
For this week project I created a calender planner with existing code. I implemented web apis along with server api such as jquery and dayjs to complete this project.

# Steps
1. Create schedule box element in html
2. Implement dayjs features along with setinterval
3. Let each element listen to current hour and update the class
4. save the data of the textarea into local storage

# Additional Steps
